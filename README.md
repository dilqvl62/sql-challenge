# Sql-challenge
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

# Dataset:

[Pewlett Hackard data](https://github.com/dilqvl62/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL/data)

# Objectives:
For this project, I’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, I’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

# Data Modeling

Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like [QuickDBDLinks](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to an external site..
